FastAPI application for the Email Triage Rl Environment.

This module creates an HTTP server that exposes the EmailTriageRlEnvironment
over HTTP and WebSocket endpoints, compatible with EnvClient.

Endpoints:
    - POST /reset: Reset the environment
    - POST /step: Execute an action
    - GET /state: Get current environment state
    - GET /schema: Get action/observation schemas
    - WS /ws: WebSocket endpoint for persistent sessions

Usage:
    # Development (with auto-reload):
    uvicorn server.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    # Production:
    uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4

    # Or run directly:
    python -m server.app
